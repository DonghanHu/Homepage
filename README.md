## Hello, welcome to my homepage!

Looking for a full-time job in 2025.

### About Me

Hi there, my name is Donghan Hu, a postdoc in the Electrical & Computer Engineering Dept and the Center for Urban Science + Progress at [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). I am working with Professor Danny Yuxing Huang at [mLab](https://mlab.engineering.nyu.edu/). I received my PhD and Master's degree in Computer Science in 2019 at Virginia Tech, advised by [Dr. Sang Won lee](https://people.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/). Before this, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2017 at [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/) in Shenyang, China.


My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Privacy & Security. I am currently working on projects that explore how personal data and network traffic (e.g., digital interactions across cross-platform devices) can be used to support knowledge workersâ€”enhancing productivity, promoting self-awareness in mental and physical health, and enabling more personalized user experiences. A key aspect of my work involves empowering individuals through meaningful use of their own data. I use techniques such as screenshot-based analysis, self-reflection models, and metadata enriched with both visual and textual cues. I am also applying machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to adapt and improve user experiences based on individual needs.

### Research Projects

#### (1): ScreenTrack
Computers are used for various purposes, so frequent context-switching is inevitable. Retrieving the documents, files, and web pages used for a task can be challenging. While many applications provide a history of recent documents for users to resume work, this is insufficient to retrieve all the digital resources relevant to a given primary document. The currently available do not consider the complex dependencies among resources across applications. To address this problem, we tested the idea of using a visual history of a computer screen to retrieve digital resources within a few days of their use through the development of Scrapbook. Scrapbook is software that captures screenshots of a computer at regular intervals. It then generates a time-lapse video from the captured screenshots. After recognizing the resource by its appearance, it lets users retrieve a recently opened document or web page from a screenshot. **Below is the video about ScreenTrack.**

#### (2): AR Collaboration with Bare Hands
In many collaborative tasks, the need for joint attention arises when one of the users wants to guide others to a specific location or target in space. If the collaborators are co-located, and the target position is in close range, it is almost instinctual for users to refer to the target location by pointing with their bare hands. While such pointing gestures can be efficient and effective in real life, performance will be impacted if the target is in augmented reality (AR), where depth cues like occlusion may be missing if the pointer's hand is not tracked and modeled in 3D. We present a study utilizing head-worn AR displays to examine the effects of incorrect occlusion cues on spatial target identification in a collaborative barehanded referencing task. Our work also identified mixed results on the impact of spatial relationships between users.

#### (3): Scrapbook
Modern users typically open multiple software programs, websites, and documents for daily tasks. Retrieving previously used digital resources, such as web pages and documents, for knowledge workers is inevitable but can be time-consuming. People may fail to remember where the resource is. In addition, sometimes, users need to retrieve digital resources across multiple applications to resume a computing task. However, the current methods - bookmarks and file systems - for curating such resources are limited in their capacity and dispersed over multiple applications. To address the above problems, we test the idea of curating digital resources by developing Scrapbook, a software that allows users to curate digital resources with screenshots. Scrapbook enables users to take a screenshot of their computer screen and stores metadata of captured applications in the screenshot. Later, users can utilize multimodal (visual and textual) information to retrieve the information they want to recall or restore the working context of a certain task.
